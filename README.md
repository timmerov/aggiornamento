# Aggiornamento

This is the code that goes with with (as of yet unreleased) e-book "Multi-threaded Coding Best Practices C++, NSFW"
(Link to the e-book will be provided upon release.)

These examples demonstrate the concepts discussed in the e-book.

The code is NOT production ready. For example, error checking is minimal. Handling errors is left as an exercise for the reader.
