# we want all projects to use the same version of cmake.
# we'd like to put the cmake_minimum_required here.
# but cmake ignores the command when it's in an included file.
# dumbass thing.
# so we do the next best thing.
# set a variable here.
# and call cmake_minimum_required from the top level CMakeLists.txt
# wee.

# replace cmake's choice of builds with just debug and release
set(CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES Debug Release CACHE TYPE INTERNAL FORCE)
